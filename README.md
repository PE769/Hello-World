# Hello-World
PE769 here. I was hacked 4 months on every device so I developed an interest in Cybersecurity and coding. I don't have a clue about much of it other than watching videos on YouTube. I bought some books I need to start reading. Any pointers are appreciated. I'm a slow learner but I've got plenty of time to learn it.
